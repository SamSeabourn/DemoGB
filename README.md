# DemoGB  - Try, share and buy real Gameboy games.

### General Assembly SEI31

### About Demo GB


Inspired by the growing community of people developing games for the original Gameboy, I decided to build a platform that would allow people to share their own demos and trial games that other developers had made. In addition I wanted to be able to produce physical copies of these games for the 1989 console, so I bought the hardware to do so.  
  
This app demonstrates a JavaScript Gameboy emulator running in the browser and the ability to upload, mount and play .gb files from cloud storage. This app was built in just over a week using Node.js, Express, Mongo.DB, Bcrypt and Cloudinary. I designed this platform mobile-first as I wanted to focus on making the app user friendly for mobile users.  
  
As part of this project I built and published a game as a proof of concept. The game is a little story about myself and is fully playable on the site as well as on console. This POC was built in a week.
